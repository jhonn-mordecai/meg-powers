# Meg Powers Design
Costume design and illustration artist portfolio. Client wanted something custom that could be easily edited as needed and turned around quickly; so some minimal Bootstrap was used for some elements, while data for the dynamically-generated gallery pages uses simple PHP arrays rather than a database. Grids and layouts utilize CSS grid and flexbox, while logo and navigation graphics utilize custom font icons.
